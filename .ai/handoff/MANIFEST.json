This creates a version conflict:\n\n- The base image ships PyTorch 2.2.0\n- `pip install -r requirements.txt` will try to upgrade torch to 2.5.0+ inside the container, which defeats the purpose of using the official PyTorch image\n- Python 3.13 support requires torch 2.5.0+ (documented in requirements.txt comments)\n\nAdditionally, the `gpu-s",

However, the TypeScript client in `client.ts` treats 503 the same as any other error - it marks the host as unhealthy and fails over to the next host.\n\nThis is incorrect behavior because:\n- A 503 with Retry-After means the host is alive but temporarily busy - it should NOT be marked unhealthy\n- If all hosts return 503, the client throws \"All GPU hosts failed\" i",

Very large batches (e.g. 10,000+ text pairs) can exhaust GPU VRAM and cause an out-of-memory crash, bringing down the entire service.\n\nThis was flagged in the P4 code review (`.ai/handoff/REVIEW.md`, Minor Note #1) as acceptable for v0.1 LAN-only usage but recommended for v0.2.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1.
